# MLOps Lifecycle for Real-Time Fraud Detection in Pix Transactions

## Introduction

This document outlines the MLOps lifecycle we will employ for our real-time fraud detection system for Pix transactions. MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. 

Our MLOps lifecycle will leverage a robust stack of tools and methodologies, including Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion, Apache Spark with Structured Streaming for data processing, MLflow and Databricks for model development and management, and Google Cloud Platform with Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for scalable deployment. We will also employ the Medallion Architecture for data layering, Terraform for infrastructure as code, GitHub for version control and collaboration, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for automatic scaling, Delta Lake for data storage, and Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring.

## Data Ingestion and Processing

### Apache Kafka

We will use Apache Kafka as our real-time data ingestion backbone. Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that can handle high-throughput data feeds with low latency, making it ideal for processing Pix transaction data in real-time. 

As new Pix transactions occur, they will be published to a dedicated Kafka topic. This decouples the data production from consumption, ensuring that no data is lost if downstream processes are slower or temporarily unavailable.

### Apache Spark with Structured Streaming

For real-time data processing, we will use Apache Spark with its Structured Streaming API. Structured Streaming provides a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on the Spark SQL engine.

A Spark Structured Streaming job will consume transaction data from the Kafka topic, apply necessary transformations and enrichments (such as joining with customer data or calculating aggregate statistics), and then write the processed data to our data store for model training and serving.

## Data Storage

### Delta Lake and Medallion Architecture

For storing our processed data, we will use Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that brings reliability, security, and performance to data lakes. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and time travel (data versioning), making it ideal for building robust data pipelines.

We will organize our data using the Medallion Architecture, which defines a multi-layered approach to data refinement:

- The Bronze layer will contain raw, unprocessed data ingested from Kafka.
- The Silver layer will contain cleaned, validated, and enriched data ready for model training.
- The Gold layer will contain aggregated, business-level data ready for consumption by reporting and analytics.

This layered approach allows us to maintain data in different states of refinement, enabling efficient reprocessing and ensuring data lineage.

## Model Development and Management

### MLflow and Databricks

For developing and managing our fraud detection models, we will use MLflow and Databricks. 

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides capabilities for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. 

Databricks provides a collaborative platform for running Apache Spark workloads, integrated with interactive notebooks, a job scheduler, and dashboards for monitoring and collaboration.

Our data scientists will use Databricks notebooks to explore data, engineer features, and train models. They will use MLflow to track model hyperparameters, performance metrics, and artifacts, enabling reproducibility and easy model comparison.

When a model is ready for production, it will be registered in the MLflow Model Registry. This provides a central model store with version control and stage transitions (e.g., from staging to production), enabling a controlled and auditable model deployment process.

## Model Deployment and Serving

### Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

For deploying and serving our models in production, we will use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its managed Kubernetes service, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation, making it an ideal platform for deploying and scaling our fraud detection services.

GKE provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling our containerized applications using Google infrastructure. It handles many of the complex tasks involved in running Kubernetes, such as cluster management and orchestration.

### Terraform

To manage our infrastructure as code, we will use Terraform. Terraform is an open-source tool for safely and efficiently building, changing, and versioning infrastructure. 

Our DevOps engineers will define our GCP and GKE resources in Terraform configuration files. This allows us to version our infrastructure in GitHub, collaborate on changes, and apply changes in a controlled and reproducible manner.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

To ensure our fraud detection services can handle variable transaction volumes, we will use the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). HPA automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics support, on some other application-provided metrics).

This will allow our services to scale up during peak transaction times and scale down during quieter periods, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring high performance.

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Grafana and Prometheus

To monitor our MLOps pipeline and fraud detection services, we will use Grafana and Prometheus. 

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It collects and stores metrics as time series data, allowing for real-time analysis. 

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.

We will instrument our data processing jobs, model serving endpoints, and other key components to expose metrics to Prometheus. We will then create dashboards in Grafana to visualize these metrics, monitor system health and performance, and define alerts for anomalies or issues.

Key metrics we will monitor include:

- Data ingestion rates and lag
- Data processing job durations and failure rates
- Model prediction latency and error rates
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) for our infrastructure

By having real-time visibility into these metrics, we can quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring the reliability and performance of our fraud detection system.

## CI/CD and Version Control

### GitHub

To version control our code and configurations and to facilitate collaboration, we will use GitHub. All our application code, data processing jobs, model training scripts, and infrastructure configurations will be stored in GitHub repositories.

We will follow a GitFlow branching model, using feature branches for development, a develop branch for integration, and a main branch for production-ready code. All changes will go through a pull request and review process before being merged.

We will also use GitHub Actions to set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. On each pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically run our unit tests and integration tests, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions. When changes are merged to our main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build, package, and deploy our applications and services to GKE.

By automating our build, test, and deployment processes, we reduce the risk of human error and ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

## Conclusion

This MLOps lifecycle, leveraging Apache Kafka, Apache Spark with Structured Streaming, MLflow and Databricks, Google Cloud Platform with GKE, Terraform, GitHub, HPA, Delta Lake, the Medallion Architecture, and Grafana with Prometheus, provides a robust and scalable framework for developing, deploying, and monitoring our real-time fraud detection system for Pix transactions.

By automating the machine learning pipeline, we can rapidly and reliably move models from experimentation to production, while ensuring data quality, model performance, and system reliability. This lifecycle allows our data scientists and engineers to collaborate effectively, reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies, and enables us to deliver value to our business and customers continuously.
